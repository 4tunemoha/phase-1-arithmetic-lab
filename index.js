// Write your code here
//Create a variable called multiply set to an equation that will multiply the variables num1 and num2; the result of the multiplication should be 62.
//Create a variable called random that will generate a random integer greater than 0.
//Create a variable called mod set to an equation that will calculate the remainder of dividing variable num3 by num4; the remainder should be 4.
//Create a variable called max that finds the highest number in a set; the value returned should be 20.


//let multiply, num1, num2, random, mod, max;
//function times(num1, num2){
//    return num1 * num2;
//}
//multiply = times(31, 2);
//console.log(times(31, 2));
//console.log(multiply);
